# Preventing credential stuffing attacks

In this demo we're going to explore how [FingerpringJS Pro](https://fingerprint.com/) can easily help you to protect your website or web service 
against automated [credential stuffing attacks](https://auth0.com/resources/whitepapers/credential-stuffing-attacks). To to so, we're going to 
build a simple login form experience with a server-side request throttling based on the current [`visitorId`](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#visitorid).

![The application we're going to build](https://github.com/molefrog/fpjs-login-demo/blob/main/static/app-screenshot.png?raw=true)

Why is this important? Almost every app on the Web starts with a login form. Although, developers have being doing this for years, it's always hard 
to build a bulletproof and secure login and session management in your apps. User credentials are [being leaked](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) all 
the time, mature businesses are not the exceptions.

What you'll learn in this tutoral:
- How to build a simple login form with Remix and React
- How to implement a basic login attemps logging
- How to use Fingerprint's [React integration](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react) to get the current browser identifier
- How to implement request throttling based on that identifier

## 1. Getting Started
Let's bootstrap our app! 

We're going to use [Remix](https://remix.run/) – a React framework which is currently getting a nice adoption in the 
web community. Remix uses a slightly different approach from other isomorphic React toolkits utilizing a concept of loaders and actions. 
It might sound a bit complicated, but please bear with me, it's going to be fun!

```bash
# let's bootstrap a basic Remix app
npx create-remix@latest login-app
```

## 2. Shaping Up Our Login Form

It's nice to start with some fake implementation first, so we can focus on the real logic later on. While it's always fun to write CSS, for 
the prototype I recommend using something that doesn't require much configuration (like classeless CSS framework [new.css](https://newcss.net/)).

👉 **[Commit](https://github.com/molefrog/fpjs-login-demo/commit/3285d1153486f4fdd92176f7ce016e7ae1db9130)**

Remix provides a handy component `Form` for form submission and `useTransition` hook that we're going to use for a loader. 

```tsx
import { useTransition, Form } from "@remix-run/react";

const transition = useTransition();

// Transitions in Remix represent the navigation state
// That's how we know if the form is being sumbitted or not
const isLoading = transition.state !== "idle";

return (
  <Form method="post" action="/login">
    {/* form fields and loading indicator */}
  </Form>
)
```

Next, let's implement fake form submission: it's will only accept one hardcoded email and return an error otherwise.

```tsx
export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const data = await request.formData();

  const username = data.get("email") as string;

  // login successful!
  if (username === "admin@example.com") {
    return redirect("/account");
  }

  return json<FormResponse>({
    errorMessage: "Bad luck, please try different login or password!"
  });
};
```

## 3. Wiring It Up

Alright, now it's time to implement a real authentication which will rely on email and password stored in a database. To do that, we're going to 
create a SQLite database and provision it with some users. Let's initialize a new database file and create `users` table. Tip: to speed things up, use a GUI client like SQLPro. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE "users" (
  "id" integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  "email" char(128) NOT NULL,
  "password" char(128) NOT NULL,
  "username" char(128) NOT NULL
)
```

> ⚠️ Warning: while in this particular example we use passwords as-is, you should never ever store passwords in plain text! 
> Always rely on hashed and salted values instead. [Read this](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)
> for more information.

Now when a request comes in we just need to find if that email-password pair matches any 
record in our database:

```tsx 
// routes/index.tsx
import { findUserByCredentials } from "../db/queries.server";

// loader
export const action: ActionFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  // ... extract email and password from FormData

  const user = await findUserByCredentials(email, password);

  if (!user) {
    // no user found, respond with an error message
    return json<FormResponse>({
      errorMessage: "Bad luck, please try different login or password!"
    });
  }

  // respond with a redirect
}
```

You might notice that the file we're importing `findUserByCredentials` from is called `queries.server.ts`. That is a special [naming convention
Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/constraints) uses to exclude server-side code from the bundle when it can't automatically prune it
(the library `sqlite` we're using can only be used within Node).

## 4. Introducing Request Throttling

Finally, let's ensure that our login form is protected against malicious bots trying to brute force credentials. We're going to log all unsuccessful 
login attempts and then block the requests that happen suspiciously too often. Let's create a new table `login_attempts`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "login_attempts" (
  "id" integer PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  "visitor_id" char(128),
  "created_at" timestamp(128) NOT NULL,
  "email" char(128) NOT NULL
)
```

We'll need some way to identify requests: obviously, we can't fully rely on the email as well as on the IP (since there might be users who are sitting 
behind a NAT) – and that's where `visitor_id` column comes in. We will soon see how to obtain that identifier but for now let's write a logging function.

```tsx 
// call this method when authentication wasn't successful
export async function logFailedLoginAttempt(
  email: string,
  visitorId: string
): Promise<void> {
  const db = await openDB(); // open and init SQLite DB

  await db.run(
    "INSERT INTO login_attempts (email, visitor_id, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
    email,
    visitorId,
    Date.now()
  );
}
```

👉 **[Commit](https://github.com/molefrog/fpjs-login-demo/commit/3548c72f84394fb98241c81095f79a2647916415)**

Identifying visitors could be tricky as most of the bots are already aware of standard methods such as cookies, or IP-based identification. 
That's exactly the problem FingerprintJS solves! It is an [open-source library](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/) for bullet-proof 
device identification and it also has a Pro version with more advanced features such as persistent visitor IDs or backend-based fingerprinting.

In this demo, we're going to use an [official React library](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react) can be integrated in just 
few minutes. 

First of all, we will need to wrap our app in `FpjsProvider` to allow underlying components to use the library:

```tsx
// app/root.tsx
{/* 
  By wrapping the <Outlet /> with <FpjsProvider /> we ensure that all routes
  in our app can properly access Fingerprint's API
*/}
<FpjsProvider loadOptions={{ apiKey: FPJS_API_KEY }}>
  <Outlet />
</FpjsProvider>
```

Remix provides `app/root.tsx` file where you can customize the app-wide layout. Now, in our login component we're going to use `useVisitorData` hook
to obtain the visitor id. Note that this hook is asynchrounous and this is why it returns `isLoading` flag.

```tsx
// routes/login.tsx
import { useVisitorData } from "@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react";

// Get the current browser identifier
const { isLoading: isVisitorIdLoading, data: visitorData } = useVisitorData();

const visitorId = visitorData?.visitorId;
```

You can also [pass `{ immediate: false }`](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react#getting-started) to the hook if you'd like 
to manually trigger the identification process. 

👉 **[Commit](https://github.com/molefrog/fpjs-login-demo/commit/6e658467a339c7c025e22d42c20ce61af6c512cb)**

The only remaining part now is figuring out if we want to block current request when the number of attempts exceeds the threshold. In order to do
that, we just have write a simple query: it will get the number of attempts coming from this visitor within a fixed time interval:

```tsx
export async function shouldThrottleLoginRequest(
  visitorId: string,
  options: ThrottlingOptions = { maxAttempts: 5, periodMins: 5 }
): Promise<boolean> {
  // when does the throttling window start
  const startTime = Date.now() - options.periodMins * 60 * 1000;

  // get the number of failed login attempts for the current visitor
  const row = await db.get<{ numAttempts: number }>(
    `SELECT count(*) as numAttempts FROM login_attempts 
      WHERE visitor_id = (?) AND created_at > (?)`,
    visitorId,
    startTime
  );

  // threshold exceeded - block the request!
  if (Number(row?.numAttempts) > options.maxAttempts) {
    return true;
  }

  return false;
}
```

And that's it! Now our login form is protected against credential stuffing attacks. Obviously, there is a lot of things you can further improve in this 
implementation but I hope this tutorial helped you to get a basic glance of how visitor-based request throttling works.
