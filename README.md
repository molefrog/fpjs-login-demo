# Preventing credential stuffing attacks

In this demo we're going to explore how [FingerpringJS Pro](https://fingerprint.com/) can easily help you to protect your website or web service 
against automated [credential stuffing attacks](https://auth0.com/resources/whitepapers/credential-stuffing-attacks). To to so, we're going to 
build a simple login form experience with a server-side request throttling based on the current [`visitorId`](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/js-agent#visitorid).

Why is this important? Almost every app on the Web starts with a login form. Although, developers have being doing this for years, it's always hard 
to build a bulletproof and secure login and session management in your apps. User credentials are [being leaked](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) all 
the time, mature businesses are not the exceptions.

What you'll learn in this tutoral:
- How to build a simple login form with Remix and React
- How to implement a basic login attemps logging
- How to use Fingerprint's [React integration](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-react) to get the current browser identifier
- How to implement request throttling based on that identifier

## 1. Getting Started
Let's bootstrap our app! 

We're going to use [Remix](https://remix.run/) â€“ a React framework which is currently getting a nice adoption in the 
web community. Remix uses a slightly different approach from other isomorphic React toolkits utilizing a concept of loaders and actions. 
It might sound a bit complicated, but please bear with me, it's going to be fun!

```bash
# let's bootstrap a basic Remix app
npx create-remix@latest login-app
```
